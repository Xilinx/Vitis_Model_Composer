<h1>Lab 7: Export AI Engine Design from Vitis Model Composer to
Vitis</h1>
<p>In this lab, we will show how to export an AI Engine design into a
Vitis AI Engine component after it has been simulated and validated in
Vitis Model Composer.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the development cycle, it is critical to
verify the functional behavior of the AI Engine kernels and graph. Vitis
Model Composer is an ideal choice for testing and debugging at this
level because of the speed of iteration and the high level of data
visibility it provides the AI Engine developer.</p>
<p>To run on Versal hardware, the finished AI Engine design must be
linked to data movers running on the PL and a host application running
on the PS. This linking step, as well as the subsequent packaging of the
finished hardware image, can be accomplished via a Vitis system
project.</p>
<p>AI Engine designs can be brought into Vitis in two different
ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>AI Engine Component</strong>: Import the AI Engine kernel
code, graph code, and data sources into the Vitis workspace. Use this
approach when you expect to make changes to the AI Engine code after
exporting from Vitis Model Composer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-built Binary</strong>: Import a compiled AI Engine
graph (<code>libadf.a</code>) into a binary container. Use this approach
when the design has been fully completed and validated in Vitis Model
Composer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This lab will demonstrate both approaches.</p>
<section id="lab-system-design" class="level2">
<h2>Lab System Design</h2>
<p>The design that will be used is shown in the following figure:</p>
<p><img src="./Images/lab8_system_diagram.png" /></p>
<p>The AI Engine part of the design, consisting of the Interpolator,
Polarclip, and Classifier kernels, is simulated by and generated from
Vitis Model Composer.</p>
<p>We will show how to export the AI Engine design to Vitis so it can be
combined with the PL data movers and PS host application.</p>
<section id="examine-the-ai-engine-design" class="level3">
<h3>Examine the AI Engine Design</h3>
<p>Open and run the Vitis Model Composer testbench for the AI Engine
part of the design.</p>
<p>In MATLAB:</p>
<pre><code>open_system(&#39;aie_testbench&#39;);
sim(&#39;aie_testbench&#39;);</code></pre>
<p><img src="Images/model1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="Images/model2.png" /></p>
<p>This model implements the AI Engine processing cascade using a FIR
Interpolation block from the Vitis DSP Library and AIE Kernel blocks
pointing to existing kernel source code. The output of simulating the AI
Engine processing cascade is compared to a reference output. The AI
Engine output is also displayed on a scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To see how the input and reference output data
are loaded into Vitis Model Composer, go to the <strong>Simulink
toolstrip -&gt; Modeling -&gt; Model Settings -&gt; Model Properties
-&gt; Callbacks -&gt; PostLoadFcn</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After simulating the processing chain and verifying its
functionality, the AI Engine design can be exported to Vitis for
integration into a larger project.</p>

<h2>Approach 1: AI Engine Component</h2>
<section id="generate-ai-engine-code" class="level3">
<h3>Generate AI Engine Code</h3>
<p>Vitis Model Composer will generate AI Engine graph code from the
design.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the <code>aie_testbench</code> model, double-click on the
<strong>Vitis Model Composer Hub</strong> block.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the Hub block is configured as follows for the
<code>ai_engine</code> subsystem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vmc1.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Create Testbench</strong> option generates input and
reference output data files for the Vitis AIE Simulator, in addition to
the graph code.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Click <strong>Generate</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait for code generation to complete.</p>
<p><img src="Images/vmc2.png" /></p>
<p>After code generation is complete, explore the contents of the
generated <code>code</code> folder:</p>
<p><img src="Images/vmc3.png" /></p>
<p>The generated code folder contains a folder called <code>ip</code>
that contains subfolders for each AI Engine and HLS IP in the design.
Each individual IP subfolder contains a <code>src</code> folder
containing the IP's source code. In this design, the
<code>ip/ai_engine/src</code> folder contains the AI Engine code we will
bring into Vitis as a component. The <code>ip/ai_engine/data</code>
folder contains input and reference output data files that can be used
in AI Engine simulation and hardware validation. Vitis Model Composer
also generates Makefiles for compiling and simulating the AI Engine
design outside of Model Composer.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-ai-engine-component-in-vitis" class="level3">
<h3>Create AI Engine Component in Vitis</h3>
<p>Next, we will create a new Vitis workspace and add an AI Engine
component to it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open a Linux terminal in this lab directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your shell to run Vitis:
<code>source (path to Xilinx installation)/Vitis/2023.2/settings64.sh</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Start the Vitis IDE: <code>vitis -w work &amp;</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a new folder called <code>work</code> in the current
folder and opens it as a Vitis <em>workspace</em>. The Vitis Unified IDE
opens to the Welcome page.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Workspace panel on the left side identifies the
<code>work</code> folder as the current workspace. The workspace is
currently empty. Select <strong>Create AI Engine
Component</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vitis2.png" /></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Leave the component name and location as their defaults. Click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vitis3.png" /></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Select the <strong>Add Folder</strong> button under Import
Sources.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vitis4.png" /></p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Add the <code>src</code> folder from the AI Engine IP that you
generated from Vitis Model Composer.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous step to add the <code>data</code> folder from
the generated AI Engine IP.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The AI Engine Component must have a top-level file that instantiates
and runs the AI Engine graph. Vitis Model Composer generates this file
for you as <code>(subsystem name).cpp</code> in the <code>src</code>
folder.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Make sure the top-level file is <code>src/ai_engine.cpp</code>.
Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vitis5.png" /></p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Select a part, platform, or hardware design. In the screenshot
below, the VCK190 base platform is selected. Click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="Images/vitis6.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For information on custom platform creation,
see <em>Vitis Platform Creation labs</em>.</p>

<h3>Configure and Build AI Engine Component</h3>
<p>Our AI Engine design in Vitis Model Composer was implemented using
custom kernel code and blocks from the Model Composer AI Engine DSP
Library. Before building the AI Engine component, it is necessary to add
the kernel code's location to the component's include path.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Double-click the file <code>aiecompiler.cfg</code> in the AI
Engine Component.</p></li>
<li><p>Under Include Directory, click <strong>Add

<li><p>Add this lab's folder (<code>07-Export_to_Vitis</code>) to the
include path.</p></li>
<li><p>Because our AI Engine design contains blocks from the Vitis Model
Composer AI Engine DSP library, we must also add the following locations
to the include path:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>./xmc_aie_lib</code></li>
<li><code>(Model Composer install location)/tps/xf_dsp/L1/src/aie</code></li>
<li><code>(Model Composer install location)/tps/xf_dsp/L1/include/aie</code></li>
<li><code>(Model Composer install location)/tps/xf_dsp/L2/include/aie</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Model Composer install location can be
found by typing <code>xmcPathInfo</code> in the MATLAB Command
Window.</p>
