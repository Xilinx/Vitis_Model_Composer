# Vitis Model Composer

Starting from the 2020.2 version, we are storing and managing a subset of the product examples in GitHub. This way, users will always have access to the latest and most up-to-date examples. You can get the examples from this repository or directly from the tool.

:warning:**To see the examples in GitHub, switch to the branch corresponding to your version of Model Composer by clicking 'main' above**

To get the examples and explore them in Model Composer, use one of the three methods below:

## Directly download the examples from Model Composer
This is the recommended way to get the latest examples for Model Composer. Type 'doc' in the MALTAB command window. In the 'Supplemental Software' section, click on 'Xilinx Model Composer', and then click on 'Model Composer Examples'. This method will automatically get you the right version of the examples.
