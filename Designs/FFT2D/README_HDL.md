# 2D FFT using both AI Engines and Programmable Logic (HDL)
In this section we showcase a 2D-FFT design using both AI Engines and Programmable Logic.
Two 1D FFTs are implemented on AI Engiens and a transpose operation is implemented using HDL blocks on the programmable logic.

## Knowledge nuggets
:bulb: You can seamlessly connect AI Engine blocks to HLS kernel blocks.

:bulb: _AIE to HDL_ blocks may are needed for connectivity between AIE blocks and HDL blocks.
